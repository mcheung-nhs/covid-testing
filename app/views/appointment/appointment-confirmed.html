      <p class="govuk-body">Some test sites offer a choice: either an assistant can do the swab test for you, or you can choose to do it yourself (instructions will be given).</p>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">In other sites, there will only be one way to have the test.</p>
      
      <p class="govuk-body">You’ll receive your test results by text message. Most people get their results within 48 hours, but it could take up to 5 days.</p>

        <li>a copy of your test site pass – this has now been emailed and texted to you</li>
        <li>photo ID – either your driving licence or passport</li>
        <li>hand-sanitiser or antiseptic wipes – because we may ask you to self-test, so you’ll need clean hands (if you have neither we’ll provide you with a pair of latex-free gloves)</li>
